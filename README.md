# Monster-Game
Text based adventure game fighting through three monsters to get to the pile of gold.
A class project for my CMP 326 class known as Programming Methods 2. Very excited to work what would be my very first
text based game, and was very pleased with the end result.

# Built With
The game was developed using Java on Eclipse.

# Improvement in the future?
I plan on adding a geminglog where it records the gaming process into a file, where the user is able to see his/her previous
process.
